Both simulated and measured channel impulse response (CIR) are integrated into the first release of dataset for deep learning in underwater acoustic communication, which is called Underwater Acoustic Channel Impulse Response Datasets (UWA-CIRset).
Due to  the dataset take up a huge amount of storage space, it has been uploaded to the network disk.
